This application is a full-stack MERN application that was created and hosted in a docker container.
The applications purpose is to demonstrate knowledge of Continous Inegration Lifecycle and Docker Containers.

Technologies used: 
Docker for containerization and application hosting. 
Docker allows the application to be ran inside a docker container when someone pulls down the image hosting the application.
The application will then run inside a Docker Container and not the host machine.
This means the  user will not have to strain their local device or resources and can run the applications on the cloud.

React JS: React was used for the frontend framework. 
NodeJS: Node was used as the JavaScript runtime to run server-side code on the backend.
Express: Express js is a javascript routing framework that is used to connect the frontend to the backend routing.
